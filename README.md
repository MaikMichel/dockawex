When you are building against **local** machine, you can pack all files into the directories called "_binaries"
```shell
deployment/docker/apex_deployment/_binaries
  instantclient-basic-linux.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip
  instantclient-sqlplus-linux.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip

  ords-18.3.0.270.1456.zip
infrastructure/docker/oradb/_binaries
  oracle-xe_11.2.0-1.0_amd64.deb
```
From here all files are copied into the respective image.  
Otherwise when building against remote machine, load the files into a directory of your choice (your website, S3, ...) from where they must be accessible via http(s).

## Local installation as development environment

#TODO ANpassen des Text
The configurations of the individual machines are stored in the "machines/*" directory. Here, each directory represents a machine. The local machine is also stored here. It is located in the folder **default**. Each machine folder contains a docker-compose.yml file "custom-compose.yml" and several `*.env` files containing the settings for each application to be distributed.


### 2. Call script **setup_local.sh** to manage your local setup
#TODO Test anpassen

1. change your working directory to the machines path: ```cd dockawex/machines```
2. build images: ```dockawex/machines$> ./setup_local.sh build```
3. start container: ```dockawex/machines$> ./setup_local.sh start```

> More parameters will be displayed if you omit the parameters. ```dockawex/machines$> ./awex_local.sh```

ready...
At http://localhost:8080/ords (or 192.168.99.100/ords when using docker-toolbox) APEX is waiting for you

## Remote installation for the public

### Prerequisite [Create an AWS account and authorized user](_docs/prepare_aws.md)

### 1. Modify AWS Settings

After you have installed and configured aws-cli and created an IAM user, you can now write your account parameters to an environment file **account-alias.env**.

1. copy the file _template.env and name it descriptive e.g. your-aws-settings.env
2. Change following parameters:

```bash
ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Your AWS Access Key ID>
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your AWS Secret Access Key>
VPC_ID=<Your AWS VPC ID>
```

### 2. Create a copy of the directory "_template" an name it descriptive e.g.  your-machine

### 3. Customizing the Infrastructure Settings ```machines/your-machine/custom-compose.yml```
#TODO: Hier fehlt text


### 4. Call script **setup_remote.sh** to manage your remote setup

1. change your working directory to the machines path: ```cd dockawex/machines```
2. build images: ```dockawex/machines$> ./setup_remote.sh your-aws-settings your-machine-name build```
3. start container: ```dockawex/machines$> ./setup_remote.sh your-aws-settings your-machine-name start```

> More parameters will be displayed if you omit the parameters. ```awex/machines$> ./awex_remote.sh```

ready...

## Deploy an APEX-App
#TODO: Eigenen Container draus machen
If you want to use the `dockawex` deployment container, you can place one env file per application in the respective machine folder. Here `dockawex` expects two repositories. One for the application itself and the other one to install patches on top of the initaly installed application. Directory of the APP-repoy must have the following structure:
```bash
  apex
    fxxx                        -> Application folder with splitted structur underneath
      enable_build_options.sql  -> called by pre_install.sql and sets build options defined in app.env
      install.sql               -> called by pre_install.sql and generated by APEX exporter
      pre_install.sql           -> called by installation container
    rest
      install_ldc.sql           -> called by installation container
      restful_services.sql      -> calles by install_ldc, exported services by APEX
  db    
    build_all.sql               -> called by installation container, when installing
    drop_all.sql                -> called by installation container, when installing, NOT on upgrade option
  reports
    *.jasper                    -> compiled jasperfiles to deploy
```
I suggest to place all other DB-objects inside "db"-folder like:
```
..
  db
    constraints
      primary_keys
      foreign_keys
      unique_keys
      checks
    source
      functions
      procedure
      packages
    tables
    tables_ddl
    indexes
..

```
For example app.env (default)

### 1. Modify application parameters

```bash
#
# DOCKAWEX environment vars
#

# user data to access git repos, you could leave that out 
# if repo is public 
#MY_GIT_USER=
#MY_GIT_PASS=
MY_GIT_USER="<REPLACE_THIS>"
MY_GIT_PASS="<REPLACE_THIS>"

# APP:          URL to repo where to find the full application
# PATCHES:      URL to repo where to load PATCHES/RELEASES from
MY_GIT_URL_APP="<REPLACE_THIS>"
MY_GIT_URL_PATCHES="<REPLACE_THIS>"

# URL to get files from 
# Oracle Client and SQLPlus
DOWNLOAD_URL=<REPLACE_THIS>
FILE_CLIENT=instantclient-basic-linux.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip
FILE_SQLPLUS=instantclient-sqlplus-linux.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip

# user data to send mails with
# this is optional and will only applied when using smtp option in deployment container
SMTP_HOST_ADDRESS=<REPLACE_THIS>
SMTP_FROM=<REPLACE_THIS>
SMTP_USERNAME=<REPLACE_THIS>
SMTP_PASSWORD=<REPLACE_THIS>

# User to Add Workspace and grant some basic roles - see dockerfile of deployment container
SYS_USER=sys
SYS_PASS="<REPLACE_THIS>"

# APEX user inclusive version some grants and acls will assigned to
# for example: APEX_USER=APEX_180200
APEX_USER=<REPLACE_THIS>

# APP / schema user who will own and or call installation / Workspace
APP_USER=<REPLACE_THIS>
APP_PASS="<REPLACE_THIS>"

# name of APEX workspace to install app to
APP_WSPACE=<REPLACE_THIS>

# name on volumes to install/clone into from git
# /u01/apps/APP_WSPACE/APP_PATH/app
# /u01/apps/APP_WSPACE/APP_PATH/patches
APP_PATH=<REPLACE_THIS>


# target application number to install to
APP_NUM=<REPLACE_THIS>

# mails from system will send to this address (notifications)
APP_MAIL=<REPLACE_THIS>

# server proxied by nginx
# this is used to rewrite calls for location / to that app
APP_SERVER=<REPLACE_THIS>

# if you are using build-options or leave it out
APP_BUILD_OPTION_LIKE=<REPLACE_THIS>

# user data to be used by jasper_report_integration
REP_USER=<REPLACE_THIS>
REP_PASS="<REPLACE_THIS>"

```

### 2. Build deployment container based on APP-settings

1. build image: ```dockawex/machines$> ./deployment.sh your-machine-name build```
1. install your app: ```dockawex/machines$> ./deployment.sh your-machine-name install```

> More parameters will be displayed if you omit the parameters. ```dockawex/machines$> ./deployment.sh```

# FAQ

1. What is the password to internal?
> It is the same as for the user sys, except with an exclamation mark at the end!

2. How can I use machines on PC2 when the are created on PC1?
> see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/machine-share

3. How can I test access to external resources via APIproxy?
```sql
    select apex_web_service.make_rest_request(
             p_url => 'http://nodeprx:3000/https/postman-echo.com/time/start?timestamp=2016-10-10&unit=month',
             p_http_method => 'GET')
      from dual
```
